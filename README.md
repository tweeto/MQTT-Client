# Readme
MQTT-Client is a native MQTT client for LabVIEW.

## What is MQTT Client?
MQTT Client is an easy-to-use object-oriented toolkit to quickly setup a communication between your LabVIEW application and a MQTT broker. Since this toolkit has been developed from low-level TCP functions, it can be used with all operating systems (Windows as well as embedded platforms using Linux RT).

MQTT protocol is mainly used in large messaging app & IoT applications but can also be used in all applications which require asynchronous messaging between devices over the network. Brokers handle complex routing requirements and delivery needs.

## Installation
Download source code and unzip _MQTT Client_ direcectory into the _vi.lib_ folder of your LabVIEW installation directory.

**Note:** This toolkit is not available through VIPM yet.

## Documentation
Source code is entirely open source and directly commented into _.vi_ files. Have a look to [Documentation](https://github.com/tweeto/MQTT-Client/tree/master/Documentation) directory for more informations.

**Note:** This toolkit has been tested with `LabVIEW 2015` and a `RabbitMQ v3.6.2` broker with [MQTT Adapter](https://www.rabbitmq.com/mqtt.html) enabled.

## Getting Started
This toolkit includes out of the box [Examples](https://github.com/tweeto/MQTT-Client/tree/master/Example/) to give you a quick overview of the toolkit API and [Snippets](https://github.com/tweeto/MQTT-Client/tree/master/Example/Snippet/) to speed up your next LabVIEW development.

## Technical Support
This toolkit is a personnal open source project and is not supported. However, do not heasitate to email me if you'd like to ask informations or contribute.

**Warning**:	This software has not been tested for safety or critical applications. Utilization of this software remains under end user responsibility.
